# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Challenge

## Overview

* Weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

 * Uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.

    * Uses `localStorage` to store persistent data.


## Specific Goals

```

Searching for city will show current and future weather conditions and adds city to search history

Viewing current weather conditions for that city will show the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity, 

Viewing future weather conditions for that city will present a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

Clicking on city in the search history will display current and future conditions for that city
