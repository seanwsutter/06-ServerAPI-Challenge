# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Challenge

## Overview


* The weather dashboard will dynamically update HTML and CSS upon searching for city. 

* Using a [Five Day Forecast API](https:/openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) 

    * [Direct Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api#direct) to get coordinates (lat, long) when searching for city name.

* Uses `localStorage` methods to store and retrieve data.


## Specific Goals

```
Searched city will present current & future weather conditions

current weather presents:

    date, city name, icon for weather conditions, temperature, and humidity. 

future weather presents:
    
    date, icon for weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Selecting city from history will present current and future weather conditions 
```
